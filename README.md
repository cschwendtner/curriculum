# Web Development 101 - A Curriculum

A 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics, with a final project included at the end

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built two games, a business app, a browser extension, and an art app, and will have learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with the modern toolchain of today's web developer. By ensuring the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part.

## Learning Objectives

TBD, according to project
