# Web Development 101 - A Curriculum

A 12-week, 24-lesson curriculum all about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics, with a final project included at the end

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two main pedagogical concepts for our curriculum: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. By creating interesting and fun projects that allow students to apply their knowledge in real time, concepts are more easily internalized. In addition, quizzing before each lesson in a low-stakes format (just a quiz, no grade) will allow students to internalize what they will learn; a second quiz at the end of class will allow students to crystalize their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

TBD for each lesson
